Title of the Project
Small description about the project like one below The integration of a chatbot within a hostel booking system, aimed at streamlining the reservation process for students and improving the overall user experience.

About
Tailored Chatbot for Hostel Booking System is a project designed to integrate a chatbot that leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user queries to the hostel booking system. Traditional hostel booking processes are often time-consuming and involve manual searches and extensive communication with hostel staff. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by creating an easy-to-use chatbot interface that assists students in addressing inquiries.

Features
Implements advance neural network method.
A framework based application for deployment purpose.
High scalability.
Less time complexity.
A specific scope of Chatbot response model, using json data format.
Requirements
Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the sign language detection system.
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow for model training, MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition.
Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV is essential for efficient image processing and real-time hand gesture recognition.
