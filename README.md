## Title of the Project
COGNIWEALTH: REVOLUTIONIZING FINANCE, EMPOWERING INVESTORS, AND SHAPING THE FUTURE OF WEALTH MANAGEMENT 

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
 Predicting financial growth for future investment is the system that is used to take all kinds of finance data and store that data in the vector database and the Llama 2 model or the system is considered as a financial advisor and if we ask some investment question or any related question towards finance it will search on the data user provided before and the response will be formatted such a way that the response is coming from a human advisor because it uses Natural language processing(NLP) to understand the human nature and respond to there emotion and the system can be used by fund researchers and a laymen user who want to invest money in any finance related sector and this system can be feed with users wanted data and for front-end the react js is used and it is a frontend library and it is single page application and it is component based library and for backend Django is used and Llama 2 and pinecone db for storing vectors of the collected data.



## Features

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
In this work, a new financial-based LLM was trained and can answer human queries on finance domains. The LLM has finance domain knowledge and is built on Llama-65B. The model is given with the data available on the application. When the user selects the data (banks), the data will be automatically loaded in the background, and the application is ready. Now we can ask as many questions to the application, and the model can answer all the queries related to finance
